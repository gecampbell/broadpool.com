<div id="center">
<p>In 1996, my family and I moved to Ascot, Berkshire (UK), to house #7
in Broadpool Cottages. This was a small group of eight homes owned by
the Crown Estates (i.e., the British royal family) and placed in a 
small offshoot of Windsor Great Park.</p>
<p>We lived there for about five years while I worked in nearby Bracknell
and, later, Wokingham.<p>
<p>In addition to being near the Royal Ascot Racecourse, the area was 
also home to members of the royal family. Prince Andrew, for example,
lived less than a mile from us, through the woods on the other side
of the A329, on the opposite side of the racecourse. We would sometimes
see his daughters, the princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, out riding
their horses.</p>
<p>There was a Ferrari dealership a few miles away, and we could 
sometimes hear the high-pitched whine of their engines as they 
sped down the A329 on test drives.</p>
<p>The woods were full of blackberries in September.</p>
